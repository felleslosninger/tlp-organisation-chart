## ðŸš€ Get started

The package exposes one javascript function that can be used on any website, or in any framework.
Keep in mind that the function **always** attaches itself to `window`.

This documentation only covers the usage of the package, and not the development of it.
If you want to read how to develop, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/felleslosninger/tlp-organisation-chart).

### Installing via npm

```shell
npm install @digdir/organisation-chart
```

After the package is installed, we need to import the css, either globally or only on the page you are using the chart.

```js
import '@digdir/organisation-chart/dist/index.css';
```

then import the function, and use it

```js
import { generateOrgChart } from '@digdir/organisation-chart';

generateOrgChart(data, 'chart');
```

The first argument is your JSON data, read more about setting up your data below.
The second argument is the id of the container where you want the chart to show.

### Installing via `<script>`

We recommend to build your own copy of the package.
Copy the `index.css` file and `umd/index.js` file into the location you want to use it.
You can read about how to do this below.

```html
<script src="path/to/orgchart/index.js"></script>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
  href="path/to/orgchart/index.css"
/>
```

```html
<script>
  window.generateOrgChart(data, 'chart');
</script>
```

It it possible to use services like jsdelivr to get the package, but we recommend to build your own copy.

## Behaviour

The chart is responsive on any device, and looks at the width of the parent container to check if it needs to change.
This means that if your chart is in a small container, it will change to fit that container - no media queries needed.

We use these breakpoints:

| Name   | Breakpoint   |
| ------ | ------------ |
| main   | > 1500       |
| laptop | < 1500 > 992 |
| tablet | < 992 > 768  |
| mobile | < 768        |

### Rules

To ensure the chart functions correctly, it is designed to adhere to a set of rules:

#### Rules for columns:

- A column can contain a node with children, or two nodes that share children.
- A column containing two nodes that share children will take up twice as much space as a column with only one node. We refer to this type of column as a special column.
- A node that is to have children can have as many children as the user desires.

#### Rules for Rows:

- The first row must, and can only have one column.
- A row must have at least one column, and can have up to six columns.
- If a row contains columns with two nodes that share children, also known as a special column, this column will occupy the space of two columns.
  - This means that if a row contains one special column, there is only room for four regular columns.
  - If a row contains two special columns, there is only room for two regular columns.
  - If a row contains three special columns,
    then the row is full, and the user must start on a new row.
- It is worth noting that the last row in the chart may behave a bit differently compared to the rest of the rows. It should be created in the same way as the other rows. The difference is that the last elements in the row will center themselves relative to the rest, the way this works depends on the number of columns in the row and how much space the row has.

---

## Accessibility

By default the chart gets a `role="tree"`, and every child gets a `role="treeitem"`. This is done to make screenreaders be able to parse the content as a tree of connected nodes.
We automatically add levels to the nodes, and the screenreader will read out the level of the node.

Some browsers or screenreaders might work differently, but this is a limitation with the programs, and not the chart.

You are free to choose the color of your boxes, however we don't check the contrast between background and foreground.

---

## JSON structure

<JsonView src={data} />

The above JSON structure is the minimum required to generate a chart. Let's go through the different properties one by one:

### Nodes

Nodes are the boxes that will be rendered out, this is where you customize the rendered content.
Each node must always have an id, a title, background-color and text-color. Keep in mind that the id must be unique.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Root",
      "backgroundColor": "#0062BA",
      "textColor": "#fff"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "title": "Item",
      "backgroundColor": "#1e2b3c",
      "textColor": "#fff"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can send in more props, to further customize how the nodes look.
For example, you can make the node a link.

| Key             | Type   | Required? |
| --------------- | ------ | --------- |
| id              | string | yes       |
| title           | string | yes       |
| backgroundColor | string | yes       |
| textColor       | string | yes       |
| url             | string | no        |
| border          | string | no        |
| opacity         | string | no        |

### Layouts

The layouts key is used to define how the nodes should connect to eachother.
This is always required, and might be difficult to understand at first.

You can see examples on [Github](https://github.com/felleslosninger/tlp-organisation-chart/tree/main/apps/react/src/data).

```json
{
  "layouts": {
    "main": {
      "rows": [
        {
          "row": [
            {
              "id": ["root"],
              "alignment": "center",
              "component": {
                "type": "root",
                "children": ["item1"]
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "row": [
            {
              "id": ["item1"]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can define a layout for each of our breakpoints, or you can use the same layout for all of them.

We split the layout into rows, and each row can have multiple nodes. Refer to the REGLER HERE for more information
about limitations.

### TOC

The TOC (Table of Contents) is a legend that shows what your different nodes are.
We do not generate this, so make sure to keep this updated to be on par with your nodes.

```json
{
  "toc": {
    { "title": "Root", "uid": "root" },
    { "title": "Item", "uid": "child" }
  }
}
```

### Meta

The meta object is used to define a name, and the language code. This key is optional.

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "title": "Test",
    "langcode": "no"
  }
}
```
