# TLP Organization Chart

## Development

Run `pnpm install` in the root directory.

To make use of the package in our react testing application, we need to link the packages locally.

Go into the root folder and run

```console
pnpm run:dev
```

Everything should work fine, and it watches for changes done in `packages/org-chart`, and rebuilds the package to be used in react.
